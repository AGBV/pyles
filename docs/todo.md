# TODO
As of 01.07.2022. pyles only implements the celes functionality until the calculation of the scattering coefficients.
These are needed for the new `optics` class to calculate parameters found in [MSTM](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/~dmckwski/scatcodes/).
Expanding the functionality of pyles and improving its code base will be tracked in the TODO list here.
In the future, if needed, this will be presented more like a roadmap :)

- [ ] Create pages for the documentation
- [ ] Orient the created documentation around the [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework
- [ ] Complete the documentation of the code
